					<h1> The Sun dial</h1>
					<h3>The creation of the sun dial</h3>
					<p>A device that shows thae time using the sun's shadow, depending on its position in the sky. The earliest archeological evidence of a sundial was found in the valley of kings in upper Egypt in 2013, and it dates back to 1500 BCE. A larger version of the sundial is the obelisk, which was used to mark the summer and winter solstices.<br>
					Egyptians divided their sundials into 12 parts for each hour of the day from dusk to dawn. Although sundials were quite accurate for their time, they had one very evident disadvantage. They were practically useless during overcast days and at night.</p>

					<h1>The Water clock</h1>
					<p>In order to bypass the <b>"no sunlight"</b> conundrum, the Egyptians needed another method of time keeping and so they developed the water clock. <br> Egyptians would fill a bowl-shaped container with water. Said water had a spout at the bottom which would allow for water to flow out into another container. It had 12 markings on the inside, each line representing the passing of an hour. As the water flowed out, they would compare the water level with the markings to determine how much time had passed. The problem with this type of water clock was that it didn't provide an accurate representation of the passage of time. As the container emptied out, pressure of the water would lessen, making the water run more slowly by the end.</p>

					<h1>The Candle clock</h1>
					<p>While Egyptians, Romans and Greeks, were using sundials to keep track of time, people in asia were using candles. <br> Candle clocks worked as follows: Each candle had markings on its sides indicating the passage of a certain period of time. So as the candle burned you could calculate how much time had expired. <br> Back to 520 AD in a poem written by chinese thinker You Jiangu, who seemed to use them for study sessions.</p>

					<h1>The weight clock</h1>
					<p>Invented in Europe, the weight clock was the first mechanical clock ever created. It invovled having weights to use the force of gravity to help turn gers in the clock.<br>The gravitational pull generally lasts for up to seven days, at which time the weights need to be pulled back up. The weights hang on either cables or chains and are pulled up by either winding the cables up with a crank that gets inserted into the holes on the front of the dial or by manually pulling up the chains. Most weight-driven clocks will also produce a chime.</p>

					<h1>The Hour glass</h1>
					<p>Invented in france in 1338, the hour glass involves an amount of fine sand pouring through a small hole constantly in a certain amount of time.<br>It comprises two glass bulbs connected vertically by a narrow neck that allows a regulated flow of a substance from the upper bulb to lower one. Typically, the upper and lower bulbs are symmetric. So that the hourglass will measure the same duration regardless of orientation. The specific duration of time a given hourglass measures is determined by factors including the quantity and courseness of the particulate matter, the bulb size, and the neck width.</p>

					<h1>The Spring-driven clock</h1>
					<p>The spring-driven clock, built in 1510, was the first successful mechanical clock. It was originally constructed by peter henlein, a German engineer. Replacing the heavy drive weights permitted smaller (and portable) clocks and watches. Although they ran slower as the main spring unwound, they were popular among wealthy individuals due to their small size and the fact that they could be put on a shelf or table instead of hanging on the wall or being housed in tall cases. These advances in design were precursors to truly accurate timekeeping.</p>

					<h1>The Pendulum clock</h1>
					<p>The Pendulum clock, invented by christiaan Hygens in 1656, is a clock that powered by a swinging pendulum to keep time. <br>Galileo had the idea to use a swinging bob to regulate the motion of a time-telling device earlier in the 17<sup>th</sup> centuary.<br>Chirstiaan Huygens, determined the mathematical formula that related pendulum length to time and had the first pendulum-driven clock made.It swings back and forth in a precise time interval dependent on its length, and resists swinging at other rates. The pendulum clock was the world's most precise timekeeper, accoundting for its widespred use. </p>

					<h1>The Quartz clock</h1>
					<p>Quartz clocks are timepieces that use an electronic oscillator regulated by a quartz crystal to keep time. This crystal oscillator creates a signal with very precise frequency. So that quartz clocks are at least an order of magnitude more accurate than mechanical clocks.<br>
					Generally, some form of digital logic counts the cycles of this signal and provides a numerical time display, usually in units of hours,minutes, and seconds. <br> Since the 1980's when the advent of solid-state digital electronics allowed them to be made compact and inexpensive, quartz timekeepers have become the world's most widely used timekeeping technology, used in most clocks and watchers as well as computers and other appliances that keep time.</p>

					<h1>The Atomic clock</h1>
					<p>Atomic clock is a clock whose time keeping mechanism is based on the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with the excited states of certain atoms. Specially, either a hyperfine transition in the microwave region, or an electron transition in the optical or ultra violet region, of the emission spectrum of an atom is used as a frequency standard for the timekeeping element. Atomic clocks are the most accurate time and frequency standard known, and are used as primary standards for international time distribution services, to control the wave frequency of television broadcasts, and in global navigation satellite systems such as GPS.
						<br> The princiiple of operation of an atomic clock is based on atomic physics: it measures the electromagnetic signal that electrons in atoms emit when they change energy levels. Early atomic clocks were based on measers at toom temperature. Since 2004, more accurate atomic clocks first cool the atoms to near absolute zero temperature by slowing them with lasers and probing them in atomic fountains in a microwave-filled cavity. An example of this is the NIST-F1 atomic clock, one of the national primaty time and frequency standards of the United States.</p>
